I just moved to a MAC recently. I get asked this all the time, so I thought I would write down the **MAC apps** that I've found that help in my work. This is not meant as a comprehensive guide by any means! If you do have any suggestions on apps that you have found that are of this ilk, please do let me know. I would love to try them. (The ones marked with $ are not free). 

**Must install** / use apps:

* [Raycast](http://www.raycast.com): replacement for native app launcher. Much quicker and with an awesome set of plugins. I use it to launch apps (obviously), search for files, save frequently used snippets (e.g., for introductions), time in location X, date math (e.g., 7/4/2023 + 8 weeks) etc. (If you are more ambitious, you can also write your own plugins). 
* [Espanso](https://espanso.org): Text expander. Essentially you give a short phrase (e.g., emsg and it expands to "Please let me know if you have any questions"). You probably think you don't need it, but it allows one to speed through responses. 
* [Contexts](http://contexts.co): Awesome replacement to navigate between windows. I just started using just a little while ago and I'm hooked. I used to use Alt-TAB, but this is so much quicker / easier. $
* [Superhuman](https://superhuman.com/): My favorite email client period. It's full of keyboard shortcuts, snippets (email templates) that allow one to speed through email. Not great for calendar (yet). $. Recently got bought by Grammarly; I hope they don't f it up. 
* [Marta](https://marta.sh/): Two pane filemanager. I used to use fman, but I've moved to Marta. My default filemanager. 
* [VimCal](https://www.vimcal.com/): Awesome keyboard friendly calendar app. Key feature is the ability to parse natural language (e.g., Coffee with x@y.com tomorrow at 2 pm PST). And it is fast. $
* [Granola](https://www.granola.ai/): Game changer for taking notes. You take notes and then the the tool using the transcription to enhance. Plus you can interrogate the notes. 
* [Godspeed](https://godspeedapp.com/): I've probably tried every single to do app out there. This one is the latest incarnation, and I only started using it a little while ago. Key feature: It's fast and has good keyboard shortcuts. 
* [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/): A RSS reader that allows you to use the keyboard properly and scroll between your feeds. 
* [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/): Simple windows management that allows you to use keyboard shortcuts to move windows to different positions on the screen. (Slightly duplicative of what Amethyst does, but it doesn't do the auto-tiling). 
* [PDFGear](https://www.pdfgear.com/): I've started using this instead of the bloatware that is Adobe. Much faster and doesn't require me to sign in multiple times or try to update every 4 minutes. 
* [Homerow](https://www.homerow.app/): This allows one to use a keyboard shortcut to search for items to click on.
* Plus of course all the AI tools: [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/), [Claude](https://claude.ai/), [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), [warp (for terminal)](https://www.warp.dev/), [Cursor for coding](https://www.cursor.com/) etc.

Nice to have but **not critical**:

* [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/): A tool to help you automate tasks on the Mac via shortcuts and light scripting. I use it to launch apps via shortcuts mostly. Need to play with it more. 
* [Vimac](https://vimacapp.com/): Another one like Homerow that allows you to use a keyboard (Ctrl F) to search for things to click on / navigate. (I guess Vimac turned into Homerow! Anyway, I have both).     
* [Itsycal](https://www.mowglii.com/itsycal/): Small lightweight calendar in menu bar
* [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/): Allows you to hide elements in the menu bar (which can get crowded). 
* [Amphetamine](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12): Allows you to keep the MAC awake (even when it wants to sleep). Reminds me of rough nights in consulting! 
* [Amethyst](https://ianyh.com/amethyst/): Automatic windows manager that auto tiles the windows. I've found it a bit flaky (i.e., need to restart the app), but it has great keyboard bindings so that you can hop between windows without having to touch the mouse. I was using this, but I find Rectangle good enough. 
  
  

Used to use but <u>stopped using</u>: 

- [Arc](https://arc.net/): Newer addition, but almost my default browser. Killer feature is the ability to have multiple tabs open side by side. Plus of course it has some good keyboard bindings. Now deprecated. I'm trying [Dia](https://www.diabrowser.com/).
- [Fman](https://fman.io/): File / directory navigator that works with keyboard / shortcuts. Dual panel. Maybe it's just me, but I don't like the native Mac finder app. This one allows you to navigate very quickly. I moved to Marta.
- [Texts.com](https://texts.com/): I just started using this. Unifies texts from WhatsApp, iMessage, Signal (this one is flaky) etc. into a keyboard friendly interface. I still need to get used to the keyboard shortcuts. Bit flaky e.g. Signal is down more than up. $. I stopped using this since it was too flaky / didn't work all the time.
