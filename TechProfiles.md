**Enterprise SW leader profiles** that I know about that are looking

* ex-CTO/CTPO deep in infra
* Chief Transformation type guy
* President/GTM (more background in sales) -- ideally looking for a first time CEO gig
* COO
* A few CEO candidates (some ex, some first timers)
* CMO
* Lots of people with sales strategy/sales ops
* Product managers
* Ex-consultants (various levels); public ones: [Mohd. Zain - Project Lead](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohammedzain/)
* Ecosystem leader 🆕


**Positions open** that I know about

* CorpDev at two separate nid-maket data related companies. Both would report to the President (who is CEO-1) 


If you have any needs that fit, please let me know. 🙏 (I’m not a recruiter – just trying to help make connections!).
