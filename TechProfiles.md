**Enterprise SW leader profiles** that I know about that are looking

* Chief Transformation type guy
* President/GTM (more background in sales) -- ideally looking for a first time CEO gig
* COO
* A few CEO candidates (some ex, some first timers)
* CMO
* Lots of people with sales strategy/sales ops; Public one: [Mark Wohlfarth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-wohlfarth/)
* Product managers
* Ex-consultants (various levels); Public ones: [Mohd. Zain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohammedzain/), [Mark Koskei](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-koskei/)
* Ecosystem leader


**Enterprise SW positions open** that I know about

* CorpDev at two separate mid-maket data related companies. Both would report to the President (who is CEO-1)
* CCO (Chief Customer Officer) for a mid-market infrastructure SW company
* SVP of cross company ops for a mid-market infrastructure SW company

If you have any needs that fit, please let me know. 🙏 (I’m not a recruiter – just trying to help make connections!).
