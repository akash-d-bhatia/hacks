### Quick set of scripts / hacks that maybe others find useful

* First, there's a [script](ZoomCapture.lua) that uses Lua / [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/) to automate taking **screenshots of your zoom session** with a shortcut
* Second, there's a starter **list of tech events in ICAL format** for 2024 [here](./tech_events/TechEventsCalendar.ics). It is based on an [excel file](./tech_events/TechEventsExcel.xlsx) and a simple python script that converts the excel into the ics format. Note: This is just a starter list. I need to add more events to it!
