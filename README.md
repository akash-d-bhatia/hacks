### Quick set of scripts / hacks that maybe others find useful

* First, there's a [script](ZoomCapture.lua) that uses Lua / [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/) to automate taking **screenshots of your zoom session** with a shortcut
* Second, there's a starter **list of tech events in ICAL format** current for June 2025 [here](./tech_events/eventsJune2025.ics). (Based on image to .ics conversion!)
* Third, a set of [Mac apps](./macsetup/README.md) that I tend to use. I just started using Mac after years of suffering with Windows, so I'm sure this list is far from complete!
